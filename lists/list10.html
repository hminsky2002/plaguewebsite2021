            <h1>FRAN LEBOWITZ SAID <I>WHAT</I>!?</h1>
            <p>
                <b><u>Favorite Fran Lebowitz quote</u></b><br>
                I feel like white Fran Lebowitz<br>
                Books are like people you can shred<br>
                Keep Calm and Carry on My Wayward Son<br>
                I’m horny as FUCK<br>
                Do or do not, there is no try<br>
                No real New Yorker has ever had sex. Sex is for the suburbs, darling!<br>
                I shot Biggie<br>
                Oops! I Sharted Again<br>
                I swear that wasn’t a queef.<br>
                Can you come into my apartment and help me “torrent” something called “Aphex Twin”<br>
                <br>
                <b><u>WHERE DID I PUT MY KEYS!?</u></b><br>
                Left them at the last physical Plague meeting<br>
                It’s warm and dark, but I’m not telling<br>
                NYU threw them out during Spring Break 2020 along with my RBG flask<br>
                I was doing a TikTok challenge where I eat them and then wait for them to come out<br>
                I put them inside of Tel Aviv and now they are back in the States and selling Dead Sea soap in New Jersey<br>
                Obviously, I hid them in my pussy<br>
                <br>
                <b><u>What is your bodega order?</u></b><br>
                Pizza sticks day at lunch<br>
                A bagel and a bottle of wine<br>
                I’ll have what he’s having.<br>
                Smelt on spelt<br>
                Beets on wheat<br>
                Fry on rye<br>
                Mac, stacked<br>
                Patty, melted.<br>
                <br>
                <b><u>What’s going on in the news?</u></b><br>
                They found signs of good pussy on the moon<br>
                Someone is being stinky!<br>
                Margaritaville Mayor runs for second term<br>
                Mr. Potato Head received an honorary PhD… he is now Dr. Potato Head<br>
