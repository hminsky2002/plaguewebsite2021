                <h1>Pisces Season is Hunting Season</h1>
                <p>February 19, 2021</p>
                <p>INDIANAPOLIS, IN&mdash; It&rsquo;s now Pisces season! I&rsquo;ve been wronged by too many pisces&rsquo; in my life that I&rsquo;ve decided they all must get punished; just all around awful people, pisces. Well, how do I know if they&rsquo;re a pisces? Easy! Everyone in town celebrates their birthday at the hottest full-service restaurant and video arcade: Dave and Busters. So every night between 2/19 and 3/20, I sit at the bar and observe patrons as they come and go. Some are there with kids, just an interruption in their depraved philistine lives. Others, in celebration of their depravity, celebrate their life in this establishment. My role is to rob them of their joy. I establish a target when I see a birthday candle or hear that well-known anthem, &ldquo;Happy Birthday to You.&rdquo; There is a marginal Russian population, and those folks may sing the Soviet song, &ldquo;Пусть бегут неуклюже (Pust&apos; begut neuklyuzhe)&rdquo; by Krokodil Gena. Anyway, I steal all their Dave and Busters tickets while they&rsquo;re distracted by expressions of insincere love. And every year I feel just as satisfied by the sad tears spilled and angry holes punched into the wall of the Dave and Busters bathrooms.</p>
