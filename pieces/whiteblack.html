            <h1>White Black Jack Black</h1>
            <p>August 13th, 2008. <i>Tropic Thunder</i> has premiered in theaters nationwide. The film has already garnered some notoriety for Robert Downey Jr.’s controversial performance in blackface; or better put, his performance as an Australian giving a performance as a black guy.<br>

            Two middle-aged men in particular—a white Jew and a black Haitian—shuffle out to the Jew’s car not saying a word to each other. They drive out of the parking lot and stop at a redlight, still silent.<br>

            The Jew finally decides to address the elephant in the room.<br>
			<b>Jew:</b> You know, Robert Downey Jr. was pretty good in that.<br>
			<b>Haitian:</b> Yeah, he was pretty funny.<br>
			<b>Jew:</b> Must be kinda hard to play a...<br>
				<i>The Jew shifts in his seat.</i><br>
				<b>Jew:</b> Uh...Jack Black was also really good.<br>
				<b>Haitian:</b> Man, that shit with the cocaine—<br>
				<b>Jew:</b> That shit with the cocaine!<br>
				<i>They chuckle together.</i><br>
				<b>Jew:</b> Fact, he probably coulda done just a good a job as Downey Jr.<br>
				<b>Haitian:</b> I could see that.<br>
				<b>Jew:</b> But then he’d have been Black Jack Black.<br>
				<i>They</i> chuckle together, feeling more at ease now.<br>
				<b>Haitian:</b> Black Jack Black. Wow. That’s good.<br>
				<b>Jew:</b> And you know how Robert Downey Jr. got that medical procedure to turn his skin black?<br>
				What if Jack Black, instead of changing his skin color, got plastic surgery to have the features of a black guy, but still had white skin? Broader nose, bigger lips, whiter teeth—White Black Jack Black.<br>
				<i>The Haitian laughs and the Jew joins him.</i>
				<b>Jew:</b> But by this point, he’s become an incredibly open-minded person, so he decides to follow the path of Allah, converts to Islam, and adds Muhammed to his name.<br>
				Muhammed White Black Jack Black... no, it’s better at the end. White Black Jack Black Muhammed Al-Bin Shallah.<br>
				But now he also considers himself incredibly progressive, so he marries a woman of color and takes on her surname, becoming White Black Jack Black Muhammed Al-Bin Shallah Menendez.<br>
				<b>Haitian:</b> Wait— what?<br>
				<b>Jew:</b> Yeah... haha.<br>
				<b>Haitian:</b> Why would he take on her surname?<br>
				<b>Jew:</b> He’s pretty tubby too, right? Guy’s gotta love his Chinese food, incorporate a lotta Asian condiments into his home recipes. White Black Jack Black Muhammed Al-Bin Shallah Menendez Lee Kum Kee.<br>
				<b>Haitian:</b> The chili oil? Man, shut the hell—<br>
				<b>Jew:</b> White Black Jack Black Muhammed Al-Bin Shallah Menendez Lee Kum Kee—!<br>
				<i>The passenger door slams shut. The Jew looks over to see the Haitian stepping around cars, making his way through an empty right-turn lane toward the sidewalk.</i><br>
				<b>Jew:</b> Haitian—Haitian man! Come back! It was funny!
					<i>The Haitian man glares over his shoulder.</i><br>
				<br>Not even half a second later, an Audi R8 plows through him and sends his body sprawling across the pavement in a trail of blood. <br>
				The Jew screams, leaps out of his car, drops to his knees beside the Haitian’s corpse.<br>
				The driver’s door of the Audi R8 opens. Robert Downey Jr. stands out of the car in aviator sunglasses and a three-piece suit with a line of cocaine on his index finger. He looks at his bloodied car hood.<br>
				<br><b>Downey Jr.:</b> Jarvis, add bleach to my shopping list.<br>
				Robert Downey Jr. shoves his entire index finger up his right nostril, snorts, and screams, violently trembling. The Jew, holding back tears, stares in disbelief.<br>
				The passenger door of the Huracan clicks open. The Jew looks over.<br>
				An approximately 5’6” fatman saunters, face smeared in cocaine. His facial features dramatically contrast with his white skin. He wears an Islamic thawb skirt stretching down to his toes, a sombrero, a conical hat on top of the sombrero, and a fez on top of the conical hat on top of the sombrero. 
				The Jew’s expression drops, his soul entering a metaphysical abyss.<br>
				<b>Downey Jr.:</b> White Black Jack Black Muhammed Al-Bin Shallah Menendez Lee Kum Kee, get back in the car!<br>
				<br>The Jew locks eyes with White Black Jack Black, who grins at him with the eerie toothiness of a Senegalese street merchant. All sound mutes around them. A low-frequency, deeply unsettling rumble permeates the air and penetrates the Jew’s ears, filling him with terror, as White Black Jack Black whispers to him from afar—-<br>
				<br>“Skadoosh.”</p>
