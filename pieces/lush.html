            <h1>Lush Storefronts Have Become a COVID-19 Breeding Ground due to Employees’ Lack of Personal Space</h1>
            <p>Retailers across the country have suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic as storefronts have shuttered. While most corporations have been able to stay afloat, cosmetics company “Lush” is on the verge of bankruptcy after months of “friendly” employees violating customers’ personal space. Lush encourages its employees to not only touch but “strategically seduce” customers while offering them free samples of their products. These practices have not changed during the pandemic and customers have reported Lush employees encouraging them to “pull down their face masks just for a second to get a quick sniff” of their newest bubble gum lotion. Despite racking up countless fines for safety guideline violations (and nearly all employees and customers losing their sense of taste and smell after contracting COVID-19), Lush refuses to change their policies. In response to the backlash, CEO Mark Constantine’s released an official statement saying, “It’s worth it, even if our Peachy Klean foot scrub is the last thing you smell.”</p>
