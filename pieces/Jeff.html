                        <p>Jeff may not be the flashiest step-dad on the block.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>He still thinks college kids play hacky sack.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>He drinks responsibility. Only 3 bud lights and no drunk driving, for the most part.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Not only is he banging my mom, he brings me to improv every other weekend.</p>
                        <p>Guaranteed no sexual scandals cause he&rsquo;s only sleeping with my mom. He&rsquo;s like the reverse Eliott Spitzer.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>He plays golf on the weekend with his college buddies</p>
                        <p>His new balances are never dirty.</p>
                        <p>He goes to the gym once a month but tells his friends he goes every day.</p>
                        <p>He wrote an autobiography because he thinks his life is so darn cool.</p>
                        <p>He said he would be the topic of my college essay if I wanted him to be.</p>
                        <p>Die hard Jets fan! Doesn&rsquo;t even punch the wall when they lose.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Has given 10 dollars to every homeless person who asked him. Then said, &ldquo;it&apos;s not a hand out, it&apos;s a hand up.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Got mugged and didn&rsquo;t cry (he says).&nbsp;</p>
