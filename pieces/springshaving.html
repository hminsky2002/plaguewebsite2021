                <h1>Spring Shaving</h1>
                  <p>Spring has sprung and while no flowers grew over the long harsh winter, my body hair did. The ides of March brings forth not the question &ldquo;et tu Brute?&rdquo; but &ldquo;to shave or not to shave?&rdquo; Springtime is here and that means it&rsquo;s too hot to hide your body under sweats. Is it worth it to just get rid of months of growth? For what? Because it feels nice to act like a mosquito when you get into bed with freshly shaved legs and rub your calves together? And so as the days grow hotter and your hair grows longer, every night you&rsquo;re left wondering &ldquo;should I shave tomorrow?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s spring that&rsquo;s what you do, you mow your lawn and trim your bush. But your bush has grown into a forest, and don&rsquo;t we need to save the trees!? Should you shave your rainforest? Should we level the Amazon? Spring has sprung but your body hair can be evergreen. Braid your armpit hair, give your ass bangs, dye your leg hair green so when you lay down in the grass they&rsquo;re camouflaged and it looks like you have no legs. Spring doesn&rsquo;t have to bring the pressures to conform, cause those hairs will only spring back up. Prickly and stabby you&rsquo;ll try to shave again, only to be left bloody on the bathroom floor just like Julius seizure. And you&rsquo;ll realize all your pain is only at the gain of others.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>So should you shave this spring? That&rsquo;s up to you! If you do decide to dye your leg hair green don&rsquo;t forget to tag us on all your social media posts with the hashtag #idyedmyleghairgreentoblendintothegrasslikeacamelon</p>
